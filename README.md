# Frontend-Competition

This responsive and visually engaging homepage is designed with simplicity, clarity, and interactivity in mind. It highlights four key elements â€” Reports, Forecasts, Dashboards, and Consolidations â€” using smooth hover effects and floating visuals that react to user interaction.

The design focuses on a clean, modern layout with soft animations and a central call to action. Each keyword is paired with a themed background visual that moves gently and becomes more prominent when hovered, creating an immersive experience without clutter.

Key features of this site include:

âœ¨ Hover-activated floating visuals for interactive emphasis

ðŸŽ¯ Keyword highlighting using clean typography and hover triggers

ðŸŒ— Optional dark/light mode toggle for theme flexibility

ðŸŒ€ Subtle ripple effect on mouse movement to enhance interactivity

âš¡ Minimal loader animation to improve first impression

Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project reflects modern frontend practices with a focus on user experience and interactive presentation, making it suitable for portfolios, dashboards, or landing pages.
